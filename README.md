# biketripsdynamic_map

An interactive map of my bike trips and the amount of kilometres I rode i each french department, built with Leaflet library. This version is dynamic, i.e., the choropleth map is built via Turf's spatial analysis functions each time the map is opened. Slow, unefficient, but I learned a lot doing that!
